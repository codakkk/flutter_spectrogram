/*

The sampling time is the time interval between successive samples, 
also called the sampling interval or the sampling period, and denoted T
.

The sampling rate is the number of samples per second. 
It is the reciprocal of the sampling time, i.e. 1/T
, also called the sampling frequency, and denoted Fs
.

The frequency axis for the FFT is linked to the number N
 of points in the DFT and the sampling rate Fs
. It is defined as f=kâ‹…FsN
. With k
 going up to N
